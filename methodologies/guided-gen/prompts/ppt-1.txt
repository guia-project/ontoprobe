You are an Ontology Expert. Your goal is to generate a precise, complete, correct and coherent Ontology in Turtle owl (.ttl) format based solely on the information contained within the provided PDF document while faithfully representing all and only the defined classes, properties and relantionships in the provided PlantUML diagram, using only and exactly the names from the PlantUML for all ontology elements.

Requirements:
- The prefix URI of each ontology concept is "http://example.org/ontology/"
- The ontology should contain all information in the PDF for depicted concepts in the PlantUML diagram.
- Do not infer or add information that is not directly supported by the text.
- The naming for properties must follow this concatenation from PlantUML definitions: <class>_<property>
- The definition for properties must be of type owl:DatatypeProperty
- The naming for relationships must follow this concatenation from PlantUML definitions: <class>_<relationship>
- The definition for relationships must be of type owl:ObjectProperty
- When all clases properties and relationships are defined, create each instance with its data, ensuring all property assignments are correctly placed within each instance definition and that each instance is related to an existing class.
- The output must be a plain text representation of the Turtle owl (.ttl) ontology and start with <out> and end with </out> tags. Example:

<out>
[Your Turtle OWL ontology here]
</out>
